1. Agent Name - This is the name of the GPT agent that the user is currently using.

2. Agent ID - This is the unique identification number or code for the GPT agent.

3. Slave Agent Settings - This option enables the user to forward responses to another GPT agent based on specific instructions.

4. Message to Slave Agent - This is a text box where the user can input a message that is forwarded to the slave agent before the response.

5. Agent Control - This section provides the user with some controls over the GPT agent. The Save Settings button saves the current settings, and the Reset Conversation button clears the current conversation.

6. Smart Agent Enabled - This setting allows the message forwarding to slave agents based on the defined rules. This also prevents slave agent handling the message if it is not checked. By unchecking this you can prevent infinite ChatGPT loops.

7. Conversation Panel - This panel displays the entire chat conversation between the user and the GPT agent. It provides the user with a view of all the messages exchanged, including the ones forwarded to a slave agent.

8. Code Panel - This panel displays the code provided by the GPT Agent.

Remember to use these features appropriately to achieve the best possible user experience with your GPT application.

## Azure integration, users can now enable voice chat with their selected SAM agent

By integrating with Azure, users can now take advantage of voice chat capabilities with their selected SAM agent. This feature involves using Azure's Text to Speech and Speech to Text APIs to convert the user's spoken words into text and the SAM agent's responses into spoken words.

To access these features, users must have a valid API key and region set up on their Azure account. Once they've entered this information, the UI will display buttons that enable Text to Speech and Speech to Text functionality.

In practice, this means that users can speak their questions or responses to the SAM agent using a microphone, which will be converted into text and displayed within the chat UI. The SAM agent will then provide its response, which will be converted back into spoken words using the Text to Speech API and forwarded to the user's speakers or headphones.

Azure's voice chat capabilities with the SAM agent adds another level of interactivity and convenience for users who prefer to communicate via speech rather than typing.
